> TL;DR: As a mid- to longterm vision for the Monitoring Stack Operator we propose to establish it as _the_ cluster-side component for all OpenShift observability needs. In conjunction with Observatorium / RHOBS - as _the_ control plane / management side component - MSO is thought to manage different kinds of cluster-side monitoring stack setups covering the needs of possibly all OpenShift variants from fully managed multi-cluster use cases to HyperShift and single node air gapped setups.

## Why

With the rise of new OpenShift variants with very different needs regarding observability the desire for a consistent way of providing differently configured monitoring stacks grows. Examples:
- Traditional single-cluster on-prem OpenShift deployments need a self-contained monitoring stack where all components (scraping, storage, visualization, alerting, log collection) run on the same cluster. This is the kind of setup [CMO](https://github.com/openshift/cluster-monitoring-operator) was designed for.
- Multi-cluster deployments need a central (aggregated, federated) view on metrics, logs and alerts. Certain components of the stack don't run on the workload clusters but in some central infrastructure.
- Resource-constraint deployments need a stripped down version of the monitoring stack, e.g. only forwarding signals to a central infrastructure or disabling certain parts of the stack completely.
- Mixed deployments (e.g. OpenShift + OpenStack) are conceptually very similar to the multi-cluster use case, also needing a central pane of glass for observability signals.
- Looking at eventually correlating different observability signals also the cluster-side stack would potentially benefit from a holistic approach for deploying monitoring, logging and tracing components and configuring them in the right way to work together.
- Managed service deployments need a multi tenancy capable way of deploying many similarly built monitoring stacks to a single cluster. This is the short-term focus for MSO.

The proposal is to combine all these (and more) use cases into one single (meta) operator which can be configured with e.g. presets to instruct lower level operators (like prometheus-operator) to deploy purpose-built monitoring stacks for different uses cases. This is similar to the original CMO concept but with much higher flexibility in mind.

Additionally, supporting multiple different ways of deploying monitoring stacks (CMO as the standard OpenShift way, MSO for managed services, something else for e.g. HyperShift or edge scenarios, ...) is a burden for the team. Instead, eventually supporting only one way for deploy monitoring stacks - with MSO - covering all these uses cases makes it a lot simpler and far more consistent.

### Pitfalls of the current solution

CMO is built for traditional self-operated single-cluster focused deployments of OpenShift. It lacks the flexibility for many other use cases (see above). E.g. the reason for creating MSO in the first place - supporting managed service uses cases - can't currently be covered by CMO. See the [original MSO proposal](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/blob/master/enhancements/monitoring/monitoring-stack-operator.md) for more details.

A result of the lacking flexibility can already be observed: Red Hat teams have built their own solutions for their monitoring use cases, e.g. leveraging community operators or self-written deployments, with varying success, reliability and supportability.

## Goals

Goals and use cases for the solution as proposed in [How](#how):

* Widen the scope of MSO to cover additional use cases besides managed services.
* Replace existing ways of deploying monitoring stacks across Red Hat products with MSO.

## Non-Goals

* Create a general purpose operator to be used with vanilla Kubernetes

## How

* Define use cases to be covered in detail
* Prioritize use cases and add needed features one by one

## Alternatives

1. Tackle each monitoring use case across Red Hat products one by one and build a custom solution for them. This would lead to many different (but potentially simpler) implementations which need to be supported.

## Action Plan

TBD
